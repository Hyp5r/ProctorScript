ProctorScript
=============

What is this?
-------------
ProctorScript is a script written to help administrators keep track of who's doing what on their machines.  This script allows administrators to configure an INI file with preset options so that a user can access them easily, while computer information is recorded to a log file.

Of course, that's the ideal of this script.  In theory, it would work without any issue, but in practice, this script can be avoided entirely.  It's a good-will effort to keep track of users using an account that has to be shared out for multiple uses.  For example, night classes in the TCAT system may need access to the machines and a student roster may not be available to the admin.  With this script, an admin can record the user's first and last name, plus their general intention on the machine.

The log file records info, such as the date the account was logged in, the first and last name of the person, the computer name and what version of Windows it was running, IP addresses, and the option the user selected in the launcher.

Why use it?
-----------
If users have their own individual login, there's no point in using this script, really.  If you share a general login, however, you may want to know who's using it, when, and why.  This script also forces a message to show up when run, and the user must accept the message or be logged out.

This script is also useful for ACT Compass exams.  This script has my auto-launching ACT Compass script baked in that will automatically change the resolution to what ACT Compass wants, launches the Lockdown Browser, and changes the resolution back to normal when Lockdown Browser is closed.

CHANGELOG
=========
Rev.6 Private Test
	MODIFY: The program now installs to the root of the Windows
	directory, typically the C:\ drive.  This is due to group
	policy settings that disable execution in the AppData
	directory.
	MODIFY: The command line switches have been moved in the code
	to execute after program installation again.  This will
	(hopefully) fix the flashing window issue when using command
	line switches in the program.

Rev.5 Private Test
	ADD: Starting of the -help command switch, which will
	open a batch file with possible switches and uses.
	MODIFY: Moved the switch coding to be ahead of the file
	installation, and call file installation when a switch
	explicitly needs it.  This prevents the -source command from
	having two dumps, one into the script directory and one into
	the %TEMP% directory.
	*** This causes a currently known glitch, where using the
	other switches will cause the lockdown section to flash
	on screen before disappearing.

Rev.4 Private Test
	ADD: -source command line switch, which dumps the source
	code into the src folder.

Rev.3 Private Test
	ADD: Two new command-line switches have been added to the
	program! -actcompass will automatically launch the ACT
	Compass script, while -skiplockdown will completely bypass
	the lockdown portion of the script.
	MODIFY: Changed the order of file installation so that no
	supporting files will be added unless the script detects
	the INI file.
	MODIFY: Made sure that change.log will always be updated
	when the program is run.

Rev.2 Private Test
	MODIFY: Hide the close and minimize buttons on the launcher.

Rev.1 Private Test
	Initial Release
